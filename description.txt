I need someone to merge this example:

A. https://threejs.org/examples/?q=css3#css3d_youtube

into this one:

B. https://threejs.org/examples/?q=css3#css3d_periodictable



What I mean by merging is replacing the periodic element cards of B. by videos from A.

The videos in B. must have the same functionalities than in A (playable, functional inside buttons)

The number of videos can be changed and will impact the organisation of videos in B.



In addition:

- a button must be added in B., next to (table, sphere, helix grid) to rotate the video container so that it is horizontally aligned with the browser window;

- Table: the table containing all the video is a rectangle filled with all the videos. The videos must be organised depending on their number (1x1 -> 2x1 -> 2x2 -> 3x2 -> 3x3 -> 4x3 -> etc.). Each arrangement must cover the same space, so zooming is required.

- Sphere display: whatever the number of videos, the number of blank space must be minimal and the videos containers must be parallel & "horizontal"

- Helix, just add the videos one after the other. The circle radius may depend on the number of videos.>*

- Grid: Same as table. The videos must be organised depending on their number (1: 1 -> 2: 2x1 -> <4: 2x2 -> <8: (2x2)x(2x2) -> <27: (3x3)x(3x3)x(3x3))



Deliverable: update B. source code (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/css3d_periodictable.html)
